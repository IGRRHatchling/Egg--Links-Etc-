IGRR hatchling
	-absorb initial proposals, present proposals to the wired
	-absorb feedback via .io site and a protonmail account
	-agglomerate interest, but not too much interest, lets not facebook
	-the hatchling could be a fundamental unit of IGRR
		-contain links to databases, project goals timelines and working groups
		-reproducable and easy, until you specialize into something new
		-thus, the git = eggfile
			this could be a torrent or what have you
	-props to the RailYardGhosts
	-a bridge between traveling culture and the scientific community

raspi
	-she needs more power, captain! can't support two usbs, much less an external hard drive
	-peer review! raspi servers everywhere gitting git and talking shit

vpn
	-vpn to push new filessss;;;;;;;;is this necesary? too much of a pain in the ass?
	-bitmask might work. bitmask is a bit annoying to update. It's beta. It functions as a vpn against wingnut opponents.

	-looks about as good as ensorcel right now.
	-looks like it will never be updated (like enscorcel)
